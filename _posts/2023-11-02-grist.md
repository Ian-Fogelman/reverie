Howdy partner, lets talk about grist.

Grist is a relational spread sheet!

To get started pull the docker image:

```
docker pull gristlabs/grist
docker run -p 8484:8484 -it gristlabs/grist
```

Then navigate to localhost:8484, here you can see the Grist UI.

Click the ``+`` button to create a new table.

Click your profile icon in the upper right and select ``Profile settings``.

Create a new API key and copy it, for programatic access.
Create a environment variable called ``GRIST_API_KEY`` with that value.

Back on the document screen, click your profile icon again and select ``Document Settings``.
Copy the document ID under ``API``.

Run the following command to install the Grist Python driver: ``GristDocAPI``.
In your jupyter notebook or Python script, run the following code to add row data to your document.
This script assumes a column name of ``food``, but you can update the name to what ever you prefer.

```
from grist_api import GristDocAPI
import os


SERVER = "http://localhost:8484/o/docs"
DOC_ID = "t8Yp2tLTwzQKPVCZWydDrz"
#LIVE = bool(os.environ.get("VCR_RECORD", None))

api = GristDocAPI(DOC_ID, server=SERVER)
rows = api.add_records('Table1', [
    {'food': 'eggs', 'cost': 10},
    {'food': 'beets', 'cost': 20}
])
data = api.fetch_table('Table1')
print(data)
```
